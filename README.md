# 3D particle diffusion simulation

This is a project I did during my math modeling class. It aimed to simulate partles's free motion in a 3D space when a random force is applied. The project was done in Python Jupyter Notebook. A detailed break down of the tasks I did in this project you can see this powerpoint presentation I did [here](https://github.com/sliu-trinity/3D-Particle-Diffusion/blob/master/3D%20Particle%20Diffusions.pdf).
